# University-Enrollment

This repository contains my solutions to the practical exam for the DataCamp Associate Data Science Certification. The exam involved a series of tasks related to analyzing enrollment data for a university. Here's a brief overview of the tasks I completed:

1) Data Inspection: I thoroughly examined the dataset, assessing whether the values matched the provided descriptions, identifying missing values, and documenting any necessary data cleaning.

2) Enrollment Distribution: I described the distribution of enrollment counts, including a visualization that visualizes the distribution.

3) Course Type Analysis: I created a visualization to show the number of courses for each type, identifying the most observed course type and assessing the balance of observations across types.

4) Course Type vs. Enrollment: I explored the relationship between course type and enrollment count, supported by a visualization.

5) Machine Learning Problem: I determined that the university's goal to predict student enrollments is a regression problem.

6) Baseline Model: I fitted a baseline model to predict enrollments using the provided data, and the code is included.

7) Comparison Model: I developed a comparison model to predict enrollments, also with the corresponding code.

8) Model Selection Rationale: I explained why I chose the two models employed in parts 6 and 7, justifying my choices.

9) Model Performance Comparison: I compared the performance of the two models, employing suitable methods and including the code used for the comparison.

10) Model Evaluation: I explained which model performed better and provided a rationale for the performance difference.

This project showcases my ability to analyze and model real-world data, demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning, making it a valuable part of my DataCamp Associate Data Science Certification journey.

Feel free to explore the project and review the code and analysis for each task.
